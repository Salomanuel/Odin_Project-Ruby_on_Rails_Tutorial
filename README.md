# Project: Web Refresher

## Project: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

In this project, you'll dive right into the tutorial by building the site's static pages. In the fourth chapter, you'll get a refresher of the Ruby concepts which will be useful to you along the way. Even if you're good with Ruby (for instance completing the Ruby course), this is a good chapter to look over to see how some of those concepts are applied to Rails.

* Do Chapter 3 of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial to get started building the application.
* Do Chapter 4 of the tutorial to see how Ruby will be used in Rails.

# Project: Basic Routes, Views and Controllers

## Project: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

In this chapter of the tutorial you will build out the look and feel of the application using Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework. If you're feeling shaky on CSS, check out the CSS Lesson in the Web Development 101 course.

Bootstrap will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you -- instead of having to figure out how to make your navbar stick to the top of the screen, you just have to put the correct class onto some `<div>` tags and Bootstrap's style files will take over for you. It's a good way to quickly get something half decent up and running. In the course on HTML and CSS, you'll get the chance to design your own CSS framework, but for now Bootstrap is a good weapon of choice.

* Do the Rails Tutorial Chapter 5, "Filling in the Layout"

Course List >> Ruby on Rails >> Databases and Active Record >> [Project: Building With Active Record](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record)

# Projects: Active Record Basics

## Project 1: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

This chapter of the tutorial will give you a chance to start working with the database and models. It will guide you through setting up your first database migrations, making sure your user inputs are properly validated, and how to add a secure password to your User model.
Your Task

* Do the Ruby on Rails Tutorial chapter 6, "Modeling Users".


Course List >> Ruby on Rails >> Forms and Authentication >> [Projects: Forms](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms)

# Projects: Forms  

## Project 2: Ruby on Rails Tutorial

This chapter will take what you now know about forms and make it part of a real application instead of just a learning exercise. You'll build out the user signup form for the Twitter-clone project and integrate it with the validations you created on the database in the previous chapter.
Your Task

* Do the Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 7, "Sign-Up".
